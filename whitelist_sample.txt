# Each line is a (checkid:item) tuple

# Example: Will not consider a myignoredbucket failures as full failure. (Still printed as a warning)
check26:myignoredbucket

# By default, whitelisting something (e.g. "ci-logs") will only whitelist resources specifically called 
# "ci-logs". However, if you put ":f" at the end of the line, it will do a fuzzy match, and will
# whitelist all resources with "ci-logs" in their name.
# For example:
#   extra718:ci-logs    # Will block bucket "ci-logs" but not bucket "ci-logs-replica"
#   extra718:ci-logs:f  # Will block any bucket containing the term "ci-logs"

# line starting with # are ignored as comments
# add a line per resource as here:
#<checkid1>:<resource to ignore 1>
#<checkid1>:<resource to ignore 2>
# checkid2
#<checkid2>:<resource to ignore 1>

# REGEXES
# This whitelist works with regexes (ERE, the same style of regex as grep -E and bash's =~ use)
# therefore:
# extra718:[[:alnum:]]+-logs:f # will ignore all buckets containing the terms ci-logs, qa-logs, etc.
